  <h3> <b> What's the Biology behind flowers?" <b> <h3>
  <h5> Generally, flowers and other plants alike use <i>photosynthesis<i>. Using the energy of the sun and water from the soil to generate chlorophyll and sugars .
  This allows the plant cells to have their green color. This also also allow the plant cells to burn the sugars, releasing O2. <h5>

  <h3> <b> What is the purpose of color in flowers? <b> <h3>
   <h5> Flowers produce certian chemicals that cause color, these colors are mainly for survival purposes. Flowers use these scents in order to attract pollenators. 
Pollenators are crucials to the flowers, as they carry the male sex cells and without it reproduction can no longer occur. 

<h3> <b> How does reproduction happen for flowers? <b. <h3>
<h5> As mentioned in the previous paragraph pollenators are a crucial piece to the reproduction of flowers. Pollenators spread the pollen which fertilizes the ovules 
in the flower creating seeds. these seeds get dispersed through the evironment through organisms, the wind, etc. <h5>
